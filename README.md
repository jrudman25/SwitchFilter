# SwitchFilter
A program to choose what keyboard switch is best for you! Answer some basic questions and get a list of switches that match your needs.

You will be asked about your deisres on switch feel, actuation, pre-Travel, total travel, and mount. These are explained below.

* Feel: How tactile or linear the switch is
* Actuation: Force needed to activate the switch
* Pre-travel: Travel distance before actuation, in mm
* Total Travel: Travel distance before bottoming out, in mm
* Mount: Mount type (typically PCB or plate)

There are two versions of this project. One with a GUI, and one without that runs in the terminal. The JAR and exe are both the GUI version.

To use the exe, simply download the Switch Filter folder, unzip it, and run the .exe inside.

To use the JAR, first make sure you have Java installed. Then, download the JAR and run it.

To use in terminal, place the desired .java file (non-GUI or GUI) and the .csv file in the same directory and compile the java file. Then, run the java file of choice in the console and follow the prompts.
